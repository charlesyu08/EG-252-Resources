<p>The microcontroller laboratory exercises are designed to introduce the basics of interfacing and controlling microcontrollers through C and assembly programs, which are required for you to build a micromouse in the second term of this module.</p>
<p>You can view this document as a web page <a href="overview.html">HTML</a>, <a href="overview.pdf">PDF</a> or as a Word Document <a href="overview.docx">.docx</a></p>

<p>There are four exercises for the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise 1: Getting setup with Git – needed to complete the remaining exercises [HTML,PDF,docx]</li>
<li>Exercise 2: Keyboard interrupt (10 marks) [<a href="Exercise2/exercise2.html">HTML</a>,<a href="Exercise2/exercise2.pdf">PDF</a>,<a href="Exercise2/exercise2.html">docx</a>]</li>
<li>Exercise 3: Analogue to digital conversion (ADC) (6 marks) (<a href="Exercise3/exercise3.html">HTML</a>,<a href="Exercise3/exercise3.pdf">PDF</a>,<a href="Exercise3/exercise3.docx">docx</a>]</li>
<li>Exercise 4: Timer/pulse-width modulation (PWM) (14 marks) [HTML,PDF,docx]</li>
</ul>
<p>You will work in pairs and share the various tasks required with your partner. It is advised to spend some time prior to the timetabled laboratory sessions on preparing designs, leaving the laboratory time for essential testing and consultation. You should demonstrate each exercise to Dr Chris Jobling or Dr Tim Davies when finishing it. You should also keep a record of your work in a laboratory notebook and have it available for assessment, when required; materials presented on loose paper (other than program listings) will not be considered. A final report in print from each team should be submitted to Dr Jobling by <em>5pm on the 12th of December 2014</em> (Friday), which should include answers to questions, program design and source code for the implemented program with detailed comments.</p>
