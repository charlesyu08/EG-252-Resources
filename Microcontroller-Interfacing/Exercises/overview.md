# Microcontroller Laboratory Overview

The microcontroller laboratory exercises are designed to introduce the basics of
interfacing and controlling microcontrollers through C and assembly programs,
which are required for you to build a micromouse in the second term of this
module.

a Word Document [.docx](overview.docx)

There are four exercises for the following topics:

- Exercise 1: Keyboard interrupt (10 marks) [[HTML](Exercise2/exercise2.html),[PDF](Exercise2/exercise2.pdf),[docx](Exercise2/exercise2.html)]
- Exercise 2: Analogue to digital conversion (ADC) (6 marks) ([HTML](Exercise3/exercise3.html),[PDF](Exercise3/exercise3.pdf),[docx](Exercise3/exercise3.docx)]
- Exercise 3: Timer/pulse-width modulation (PWM) (14 marks) [HTML,PDF,docx]
- Exercise 4: Getting setup with Git -- needed prior to working on the micromouse code [HTML,PDF,docx]

You will work in pairs and share the various tasks required with your partner.
It is advised to spend some time prior to the timetabled laboratory sessions on
preparing designs, leaving the laboratory time for essential testing and
consultation. You should demonstrate each exercise to Dr Chris Jobling or Dr Tim
Davies when finishing it. You should also keep a record of your work in a
laboratory notebook and have it available for assessment, when required;
materials presented on loose paper (other than program listings) will not be
considered. A final report in print from each team should be submitted to Dr
Jobling by _5pm on the 12th of December 2014_ (Friday), which should include
answers to questions, program design and source code for the implemented program
with detailed comments. 

Note that the references listed in this document (and many others) are available
in the Blackboard site.
