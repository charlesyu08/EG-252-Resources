A sample program providing basic building blocks for your micromouse project.

It has the functions for motor forwarding/reversing/stopping and an interrupt service routine (ISR) for keyboard interrupt (i.e., `SW3` and `SW4` in the demoboard) to control motors.

In your project, the keyboard interrupt and the corresponding ISR need to be replaced by interrupts generated by sensors and relevant ISRs.
